# Horiseon-Access-Flow

## Description

I improved the accessibility of an existing website by employing essential refactoring techniques.
 - Enhancing the website's accessibility ensures ease of use and navigation for all users. By becoming more accessible, the website can expand its reach to a broader audience.
 - I integrated semantic HTML elements to provide a clear framework for the content.
 - When looking at the HTML layout, I fixed elements and placed them in a sensible order.
 - I reviewed the icons and images, then added alt text descriptions to the images.
 - I tidied up the CSS by merging similar rules and attributes, ensuring it adheres to an organized structure. In addition, I added comments to HTML and CSS for improved understanding.

## User Story

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
